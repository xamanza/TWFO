The Wearable Fashion Orchestra's Sonic Design Interaction Patch
//////////////
TWFO is a project from ESDI's Researchers and Designers who are working on textile and wearables devices.
In this project, the final step of the tech chain was a sonification from movements of the dancers with the wearable bodysuits.
That's the piece of code which performed the sonic interaction.
